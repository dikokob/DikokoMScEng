@article{Dinnissen2012,
	abstract = {Using `Simultaneous Localization and Mapping' (SLAM), mobile robots can become truly autonomous in the exploration of their environment. However, once these environments becomes too large, Multi-Robot SLAM becomes a requirement. This paper will outline how a mobile robot should decide when best to merge its maps with another robot's upon rendezvous, as opposed to doing so immediately. This decision will be based on the current status of the mapping particle filters and the current status of the environment. Using Reinforcement Learning, a model can be established and then trained upon to determine a policy capable of deciding when best to merge. This will allow the robot to incur less error during a merge compared to simply merging immediately. This policy is trained and validated using simulated mobile robot datasets.},

	abstract = {We present a recently developed algorithm for merging multiple occupancy grid maps computed by multiple robots independently exploring a shared indoor environment. The algorithm exploits the well known Hough transform in a novel way in order to produce a set of ranked roto-translations aimed to overlap the partial maps provided as input. In this paper, after having briefly summarized such method, we investigate the impact on the performance of different variations of the Hough transform. In particular, we are interested in determining the repercussions in terms of accuracy and computational time when only a subset of points is used to compute the transformation. Results are analyzed while merging maps produced by two robots exploring an indoor environment, and also using public available data sets. It turns out that the proposed method is robust and positively influenced by the use of more refined approaches to compute the Hough transform.},

	abstract = {This article presents a new approach to matching occupancy grid maps by means of finding correspondences between a set of sparse features detected in the maps. The problem is stated here as a special instance of generic image registration. To cope with the uncertainty and ambiguity that arise from matching grid maps, we introduce a modified RANSAC algorithm which searches for a dynamic number of internally consistent subsets of feature pairings from which to compute hypotheses about the translation and rotation between the maps. By providing a (possibly multi-modal) probability distribution of the relative pose of the maps, our method can be seamlessly integrated into large-scale mapping frameworks for mobile robots. This article provides a benchmarking of different detectors and descriptors, along extensive experimental results that illustrate the robustness of the algorithm with a 97{\%} success ratio in loop-closure detection for {\~{}}1700 matchings between local maps obtained from four publicly available datasets.},

The algorithm produces a set of possible transformations needed to merge two maps, i.e translations and rotations. Each transformation is weighted, thus allowing to distinguish uncertain situations, and enabling to track multiple cases when ambiguities arise. Transformations are produced extracting some spectral information from the maps. The approach is deterministic, non-iterative, and fast. The algorithm has been tested on public available datasets, as well as on maps produced by two robots concurrently exploring both indoor and outdoor environments.

In transitioning from a robot-centric approach to a system-centric approach, considerations must be made for the computational and communicative aspects of the group as a whole, in addition to electromechanical considerations of individual robots. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of mobile multi-robotic system research, with an emphasis on the confluence of mapping, localization and motion control of robotic system. Methods that compose these three topics are presented, including areas of overlap, such as integrated exploration and simultaneous localization and mapping. From these methods, an analysis of benefits, challenges and tradeoffs associated with multi-robotic system design and use are presented. Finally, specific applications of multi-robotic systems are also addressed in various contexts.},

@article{Khamis2014,
	abstract = {Establishing adequate RF (Radio Frequency) connectivity is the basic requirement for the proper operation of any wireless network. In a mobile wireless network it is a challenge for applications and protocols to deal with connectivity problems, as links might get up and down frequently. In these scenarios, having knowledge of the node remaining connectivity time can avoid unnecessary or even unuseful control/data messages transmissions. The current paper presents the so-called Genetic Machine Learning Approach for Link Quality Prediction, or simply GMLA, which is a solution to forecast the remainder RF connectivity time in mobile environments. Differently from all related works, GMLA allows building connectivity knowledge to estimate the RF link duration without the need of a pre-runtime phase. This allows to apply GMLA at unknown environments and mobility patterns. Its structure combines a Classifier System with a Markov chain model of the RF link quality. As the Markov model parameters are discovered on-the-fly, there is no need of a previous history to feed the Markov model. Obtained simulation results show that GMLA is a very suitable solution, as it outperforms approaches that use geographical positioning systems (GPS) and also approaches that use link-quality prediction, such as BD and MTCP. GMLA is generic enough to be applied to any layer of the communication protocol stack, especially in the link and network layers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {For long-term operations, graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approaches require nodes to be marginalized in order to control the computational cost. In this paper, we present a method to recover a set of nonlinear factors that best represents the marginal distribution in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence. The proposed method, which we call nonlinear factor recovery (NFR), estimates both the mean and the information matrix of the set of nonlinear factors, where the recovery of the latter is equivalent to solving a convex optimization problem. NFR is able to provide either the dense distribution or a sparse approximation of it. In contrast to previous algorithms, our method does not necessarily require a global linearization point and can be used with any nonlinear measurement function. Moreover, we are not restricted to only using tree-based sparse approximations and binary factors, but we can include any topology and correlations between measurements. Experiments performed on several publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state of the art with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the sparsity of the solution.},

	abstract = {In this paper we examine the problem of au- tonomously exploring and mapping an environment using a mobile robot. The robot uses a graph-based SLAM system to perform mapping and represents the map as an occupancy grid. In this setting, the robot must trade-off between exploring new area to complete the task and exploiting the existing information to maintain good localization. Selecting actions that decrease the map uncertainty while not significantly increasing the robot's localization uncertainty is challenging. We present a novel information-theoretic utility function that uses both Shannon's and R� enyi's definitions of entropy to jointly consider the uncertainty of the robot and the map. This allows us to fuse both uncertainties without the use of manual tuning. We present simulations and experiments comparing the proposed utility function to state-of-the-art utility functions, which only use Shannon's entropy. We show that by using the proposed utility function, the robot and map uncertainties are smaller than using other existing methods.},

	abstract = {Mapping can potentially be speeded up in a significant way by using multiple robots exploring different parts of the environment. But the core question of multirobot mapping is how to integrate the data of the different robots into a single global map. A significant amount of research exists in the area of multirobot mapping that deals with techniques to estimate the relative robots poses at the start or during the mapping process. With map merging, the robots in contrast individually build local maps without any knowledge about their relative positions. The goal is then to identify regions of overlap at which the local maps can be joined together. A concrete approach to this idea is presented in form of a special similarity metric and a stochastic search algorithm. Given two maps m and m', the search algorithm transforms m' by rotations and translations to find a maximum overlap between m and m'. In doing so, the heuristic similarity metric guides the search algorithm toward optimal solutions. Results from experiments with up to six robots are presented based on simulated as well as real-world map data},

	abstract = {For autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems, information on the actual state of the environment is fundamental for localization and mapping tasks. Localization benefits from multiple observations of the same location at different times as these may provide important information on static and mobile objects. For efficient mapping, the environment may be explored in parallel. For these purposes, multiple observations represented by grid maps have to be aligned into one mutual frame. This paper addresses the problem of group-wise grid map registration using an image processing approach. For registration, a rotational-invariant descriptor is proposed in order to provide the correspondences of points of interest in radar-based occupancy grid maps. As pairwise registration of multiple grid maps suffers from bias, this paper proposes a graph-based approach for robust registration of multiple grid maps. This will facilitate highly accurate range sensor maps for the aforementioned purposes. Large-scale experiments show the benefit of the proposed methods and compare it to state-of-the-art algorithms on radar measurements.},

Its attraction is owed to the potential commercial benefits of developing low cost yet highly effective SLAM based robotic applications. ROS gmapping package offers a lightweight incorporation of FastSLAM 2.0. The package has been used with different ROS supported robotic platforms and showed remarkable success. However, the effect of the package mapping parameters seem not to be fully exploited, especially with low cost robotic platform with no full ROS support such as Hercules platform. This paper presents a full implementation and performance quantitative evaluation on the gmapping package running on both standard PC and Raspberry Pi processors. We study the effects of tuning the number of particles, the displacement update and the resampling threshold by separately varying each of these parameters to several incremental values and running the algorithm on a recorded dataset. For each run, a grid map was constructed and the performance was evaluated based on mapping accuracy, CPU load and memory consumption. We are then able to propose a tuning guidelines to enlighten the gmapping execution while maintaining high performance.},

@article{Joubert2012,
	abstract = {In this thesis we consider the problem of building a dense and consistent map of a mobile robot's environment that is updated as the robot moves. Such maps are vital for safe and collision-free navigation. Measurements obtained from a range sensor mounted on the robot provide information on the structure of the environment, but are typically corrupted by noise. These measurements are also relative to the robot's unknown pose (location and orientation) and, in order to combine them into a world-centric map, pose estimation is necessary at every time step. A SLAM system can be used for this task. However, since landmark measurements and robot motion are inherently noisy, the pose estimates are typically characterized by uncertainty. When building a map it is essential to deal with the uncertainties in range measurements and pose estimates in a principled manner to avoid overconfidence in the map. A literature review of robotic mapping algorithms reveals that the occupancy grid mapping algorithm is well suited for our goal. This algorithm divides the area to be mapped into a regular lattice of cells (squares for 2D maps or cubes for 3D maps) and maintains an occupancy probability for each cell. Although an inverse sensor model is often employed to incorporate measurement uncertainty into such a map, many authors merely state or depict their sensor models. We derive our model analytically and discuss ways to tailor it for sensor-specific uncertainty. One of the shortcomings of the original occupancy grid algorithm is its inability to convey uncertainty in the robot's pose to the map. We address this problem by altering the occupancy grid update equation to include weighted samples from the pose uncertainty distribution (provided by the SLAM system). The occupancy grid algorithm has been criticized for its high memory requirements. Techniques have been proposed to represent the map as a region tree, allowing cells to have different sizes depending on the information received for them. Such an approach necessitates a set of rules for determining when a cell should be split (for higher resolution in a local region) and when groups of cells should be merged (for lower resolution). We identify some inconsistencies that can arise from existing rules, and adapt those rules so that such errors are avoided. We test our proposed adaptive occupancy grid algorithm, that incorporates both measurement and pose uncertainty, on simulated and real-world data. The results indicate that these uncertainties are included effectively, to provide a more informative map, without a loss in accuracy. Furthermore, our adaptive maps need far fewer cells than their regular counterparts, and our new set of rules for deciding when to split or merge cells significantly improves the ability of the adaptive grid map to mimic its regular counterpart.},

The proposed algorithm does not rely on rendezvous and calculates the unknown relative poses from the local maps of the robots. As another contribution, the uncertainty of the relative poses is taken into account by propagating the uncertainty to the past and future information using a novel algorithm. Moreover, once the relative poses are known, the integration of the information from all robots is performed using a novel batch-mode algorithm, which is a fast and efficient approach to deal with the time complexity problem. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

This work extends a previous work which is based on EKF-SLAM to the Fast-SLAM algorithm. The robots can observe each other and non-unique landmarks using visual sensors and merge maps by propagating uncertainty.

The SLAM community has made astonishing progress over the last 30 years, enabling large-scale real-world applications, and witnessing a steady transition of this technology to industry. We survey the current state of SLAM. We start by presenting what is now the de-facto standard formulation for SLAM. We then review related work, covering a broad set of topics including robustness and scalability in long-term mapping, metric and semantic representations for mapping, theoretical performance guarantees, active SLAM and exploration, and other new frontiers. This paper simultaneously serves as a position paper and tutorial to those who are users of SLAM. By looking at the published research with a critical eye, we delineate open challenges and new research issues, that still deserve careful scientific investigation. The paper also contains the authors' take on two questions that often animate discussions during robotics conferences: Do robots need SLAM? and Is SLAM solved?},

Heterogeneous map merging is a crucially important problem for scenarios where multiple heterogeneous robots collaborate to provide situational awareness in urban search and rescue, patrolling, and explorations tasks, just to name a few. To remedy the lack of uniform representation between heterogeneous map models, we rely on the ubiquitous presence of WiFi signals in today's environments. Our solution consists of three steps. First, the overlap between the heterogeneous maps being merged is determined. Second, metric correspondences between overlapping parts are established. Third, the merging is improved by exploiting the structural properties inherent to graph-based maps. Our proposed system is validated using various occupancy grid and appearance-based maps built in real-world conditions, the results of which confirm its strengths. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solution to the heterogeneous map merging problem.},

	abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a popular approach to address inference problems where the likelihood function is intractable, or expensive to calculate. To improve over Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementations of ABC, the use of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods has recently been suggested. Most effective SMC algorithms that are currently available for ABC have a computational complexity that is quadratic in the number of Monte Carlo samples (Beaumont et al., Biometrika 86:983?990, 2009; Peters et al., Technical report, 2008; Toni et al., J. Roy. Soc. Interface 6:187?202, 2009) and require the careful choice of simulation parameters. In this article an adaptive SMC algorithm is proposed which admits a computational complexity that is linear in the number of samples and adaptively determines the simulation parameters. We demonstrate our algorithm on a toy example and on a birth-death-mutation model arising in epidemiology.},

This algorithm is based on a distributed bidding model to coordinate the movement of multiple robots. Two measures are developed to accommodate the limited-range communications. First, the distances between robots are considered in the bidding algorithm so that the robots tend to stay close to each other. Second, a map synchronization mechanism, based on a novel sequence number-based map representation and an effective robot map update tracking, is proposed to reduce the exchanged data volume when robot subnetworks merge. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the use of nearness measure, as well as the map synchronization mechanism. By handling the limited communication range we can make the coordination algorithms more realistic in multi-robot applications. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Corresponding scenarios include households, offices, warehouses and parking lots, where the location of certain objects such as goods, furniture or cars can change over time. These changes typically lead to inconsistent observations with respect to previously learned maps and thus decrease the localization accuracy or even prevent the robot from globally localizing itself. In this paper we present a sound probabilistic approach to lifelong localization in changing environments using a combination of a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter with a hidden Markov model. By exploiting several properties of this model, we obtain a highly efficient map management approach for dynamic environments, which makes it feasible to run our algorithm online. Extensive experiments with a real robot in a dynamically changing environment demonstrate that our algorithm reliably adapts to changes in the environment and also outperforms the popular Monte-Carlo localization approach.},

This can be thought of as ?plane-to-plane'. The new approach is tested with both simulated and real-world data and is shown to outperform both standard ICP and point-to-plane. Furthermore, the new approach is shown to be more robust to incorrect correspondences, and thus makes it easier to tune the maximum match distance parameter present in most variants of ICP. In addition to the demonstrated performance improvement, the proposed model allows for more expressive probabilistic models to be incorporated into the ICP framework. While maintaining the speed and simplicity of ICP, the Generalized-ICP could also allow for the addition of outlier terms, measurement noise, and other probabilistic techniques to increase robustness.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a general-purpose, representation-independent method for the accurate and computationally efficient registration of 3-D shapes including free-form curves and surfaces. The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean square distance metric, and experience shows that the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of "shape complexity," one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. For example, a given "model" shape and a sensed "data" shape that represents a major portion of the model shape can be registered in minutes by testing one initial translation and a relatively small set of rotations to allow for the given level of model complexity. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model prior to shape inspection. The described method is also useful for deciding fundamental issues such as the congruence (shape equivalence) of different geometric representations as well as for estimating the motion between point sets where the correspondences are not known. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces.},

We investigate two strategies: (a) weight definition to prioritize prominence of the sensed data according to the data accuracy, and (b) model updating to determine the influential level of the newly captured data on the existing synthetic 3D model. Specifically, we propose Distance-Aware (DA) and Distance-Aware Slow-Saturation (DASS) updating methods to intelligently integrate the depth data into the 3D model, according to the distance-sensitivity metric of a low-cost depth sensor. We validate the proposed methods by applying them to a benchmark of datasets and comparing the resulting pose trajectories to the corresponding ground-truth. The obtained improvements are measured in terms of Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) and Relative Pose Error (RPE) and compared against the performance of the original Kinfu. The validation shows that on the average, our most promising method called DASS, leads to a pose estimation improvement in terms of ATE and RPE by 43.40{\%} and 48.29{\%}, respectively. The method shows robust performance for all datasets, with best-case improvement reaching 90{\%} of pose-error reduction.},

In this paper, we show that the theory of belief functions with its ability to distinguish between different types of uncertainty is able to provide significant advantages over probabilistic approaches in the context of robotics. We do so by presenting solutions to the essential problems of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and planning based on belief functions. For SLAM, we show how the joint belief function over the map and the robot's poses can be factored and efficiently approximated using a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter, resulting in a generalization of the popular probabilistic FastSLAM algorithm. Our SLAM algorithm produces occupancy grid maps where belief functions explicitly represent additional information about missing and conflicting measurements compared to probabilistic grid maps. The basis for this SLAM algorithm are forward and inverse sensor models, and we present general evidential models for range sensors like sonar and laser scanners. Using the generated evidential grid maps, we show how optimal decisions can be made for path planning and active exploration. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our evidential approach, we apply it to two real-world datasets where a mobile robot has to explore unknown environments and solve different planning problems. Finally, we provide a quantitative evaluation and show that the evidential approach outperforms a probabilistic one both in terms of map quality and navigation performance.},

Fron-tiers are boundaries separating known space form unknown space. Usually frontier detection utilizes image processing tools like edge detection, thus limiting it to two dimensional (2D) exploration. This paper presents a new exploration strategy based on the use of multiple Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs). The RRT algorithm is chosen because, it is biased towards unexplored regions. Also, using RRT provides a general approach which can be extended to higher dimensional spaces. The proposed strategy is implemented and tested using the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. Additionally this work uses local and global trees for detecting frontier points, which enables efficient robotic exploration. Current efforts are limited to the single robot case. Extension to multi-agent systems and three-dimensional (3D) space is left for future effort.},

	abstract = {Introduction This lecture is about some of the basics of uncertainty: the use of variances and covari-ances to express statistical uncertainty (" error bars " , error ellipses); we are concentrating on the uncertainties of geographic co-ordinates. This makes it necessary to talk about geodetic datums ? alternative ways of fixing the starting point(s) used for fixing geodetic co-ordinates in a network solution. It also makes it desirable to discuss absolute (single point) and relative (between pairs of points) co-ordinates and their uncertainties. We follow up by discussing some more esoteric concepts; these sections are provided as reading material, but we will discuss them only conceptually, to get the ideas across. The learning objective of this is, that you will not be completely surprised if in future work, these concepts turn up; you will be somewhat prepared to read up on these subjects and use them in your work. The subjects are (in blue): 1. Criterion matrices for modelling spatial variance structures 2. Stochastic processes as a means of modelling time series behaviour statistically; signal and noise processes 3. Some even more esoteric subjects: a) Statistical testing and its philosophical backgrounds b) Bayesian inference c) Inter-model comparisons by information theoretic methods, the Akaike in-formation criterion.},

The partial maps may for example be acquired by multiple robots, or during several runs of a single robot from varying starting positions. Our work deals with low quality maps based on probabilistic grids, motivated by the goal to develop multiple mobile platforms to be used in rescue environments. Several contributions to map merging are presented. First of all, we address map merging using a motion planning algorithm. The merging process can be done by rotating and translating the partial maps until similar regions overlap. Second, a motion planning algorithm is presented which is particular suited for this task. Third, a special metric is presented which guides the motion planning algorithm towards the goal of optimally overlapping partial maps. Results with our approach are presented based on data gathered from real robots developed for the RoboCupRescue real robot league. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

During early development of the Robot Operating System (ROS), keeping track of coordinate frames was identified as a common pain point for developers. The complexity of this task made it a common place for bugs when developers improperly applied transforms to data. The problem is also a challenge due to the often distributed sources of information about transformations between different sets of coordinate frames. This paper will explain the complexity of the problem and distill the requirements. Then it will discuss the design of the tf library in relation to the requirements.

	abstract = {Mobile robots have been making impressive inroads in a variety of domains. Within the Mining- RoX project, Technical University Bergakademie Freiberg is exploring a further frontier for mobile and autonomous robots: underground mines. The potential benefits of mobile robots in underground mining are plentiful as underground mines are strenuous and potentially dangerous working environments for humans. A higher degree of automation, with robots either acting as helpers for human miners or even replacing all human personnel deployed underground, could help to significantly reduce mining costs. In disaster cases, rescue robots could help to find missing personnel. Unmanned mines operated by robots alone would not endanger human lives at all. Further use cases, and a particular focus of the Mining-RoX project, are mobile robots that gather sensory information of the underground mine (eg for the purpose of creating detailed 2D and 3D maps) as well as monitoring environmental conditions such as air and water quality. This paper presents the design of a prototypical mobile robot for mapping and monitoring underground mines. A generic robotic platform was extended with various 2D and 3D imaging devices as well as other sensors. First results from test runs in an underground mine are reported. Maps of two sections of the mine enhanced with localised sensor measurements were successfully created. INTRODUCTION},

The use of multiple robots allows a task to be completed more efficiently, and is less prone to failure in the event that one of the robots becomes immobile. The Robotic Operating System (ROS) is a mainstream software framework being used for robotic research around the world. Despite its popularity and the very strong robotic community behind its success, there has not been much work with ROS involving multi- robot teams. This thesis presents a complete multi-robot system implemented within the ROS software framework. Specifically, this work implements a collaborative robotic system that performs map coverage of a known environment. A team of robots is designed and programmed to cover a map with their range sensors. A list of frontiers that border searched and unsearched space is maintained. Each robot is assigned to travel towards unsearched space until the entire map has been covered. The frontier-based coverage method is evaluated through a series of simulation experi- ments in which the coverage planner is tested in different map environments while varying the number of robots in the system. The ROS-based implementation of multi-robot frontier coverage is shown to successfully be able to cover an entire area with a team of autonomous robots.},

	abstract = {Mapping can potentially be speeded up in a significant way by using multiple robots exploring different parts of the environment. But the core question of multirobot mapping is how to integrate the data of the different robots into a single global map. A significant amount of research exists in the area of multirobot mapping that deals with techniques to estimate the relative robots poses at the start or during the mapping process. With map merging, the robots in contrast individually build local maps without any knowledge about their relative positions. The goal is then to identify regions of overlap at which the local maps can be joined together. A concrete approach to this idea is presented in form of a special similarity metric and a stochastic search algorithm. Given two maps m and m', the search algorithm transforms m' by rotations and translations to find a maximum overlap between m and m'. In doing so, the heuristic similarity metric guides the search algorithm toward optimal solutions. Results from experiments with up to six robots are presented based on simulated as well as real-world map data},

Map fusion is achieved through a multistep process that includes image pre-processing, map learning, relative transformation extraction and then verification of the results. The proposed map learning method is a process based on the Self Organizing Map (SOM). In the learning phase, the obstacles of the map are learned by clustering the occupied cells of the map. The clusters represent the spatial form of the map and make further analyses of the map easier and faster. Also, clusters can be interpreted as features extracted from the occupancy grid map so the map fusion problem becomes a task of matching features.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper considers the problem of merging grid maps that have different resolutions. Because the goal of map merging is to find the optimal transformation between two partially overlapping grid maps, it can be viewed as a special image registration issue. To address this special issue, the solution considers the non-common areas and designs an objective function based on the trimmed mean-square error (MSE). The trimmed and scaling iterative closest point (TsICP) algorithm is then proposed to solve this well-designed objective function. As the TsICP algorithm can be proven to be locally convergent in theory, a good initial transformation should be provided. Accordingly, scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features are extracted for the maps to be potentially merged, and the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is employed to find the geometrically consistent feature matches that are used to estimate the initial transformation for the TsICP algorithm. In addition, this paper presents the rules for the fusion of the grid maps based on the estimated transformation. Experimental results carried out with publicly available datasets illustrate the superior performance of this approach at merging grid maps with respect to robustness and accuracy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Kim2018,
	abstract = {With the rapid advancement of laser scanning and photogrammetry technologies, frequent geometric data collection at construction sites by contractors has been increased for the purpose of improving constructability, productivity, and onsite safety. However, the conventional static laser scanning method suffers from operational limitations due to the presence of many occlusions commonly found in a typical construction site. Obtaining a complete scan of a construction site without information loss requires that laser scans are obtained from multiple scanning locations around the site, which also necessitates extra work for registering each scanned point cloud. As an alternate solution to this problem, this paper introduces an autonomous mobile robot which navigates a scan site based on a continuously updated point cloud map. This mobile robot system utilizes the 2D Hector Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technique to estimate real-time positions and orientations of the robot in the x-y plane. Then, the 2D localization information is used to create 3D point clouds of unknown environments in real time to determine its navigation paths as a pre-scanning process. The advantage of this framework is the ability to determine the optimal scan position and scan angle to reduce the scanning time and effort for gathering high resolution point cloud data in real-time. The mobile robot system is able to capture survey-quality RGB-mapped point cloud data, and automatically register the scans for geometric reconstruction of the site. The performance of the overall system was tested in an indoor environment and validated with promising results.},

The problem is stated here as a special instance of generic image registration. To cope with the uncertainty and ambiguity that arise from matching grid maps, we introduce a modified RANSAC algorithm which searches for a dynamic number of internally consistent subsets of feature pairings from which to compute hypotheses about the translation and rotation between the maps. By providing a (possibly multi-modal) probability distribution of the relative pose of the maps, our method can be seamlessly integrated into large-scale mapping frameworks for mobile robots.

We are concerned with the number of robots for a given exploration task that minimizes both exploration time and cost. Minimizing time means that the exploration should be done as fast as possible. Minimizing cost means that the number of robots and their energy consumption should be as low as possible. To solve this problem, we report in this paper, on a series of exploration simulations based on ROS and MORSE using a cluster of computers. The simulated code is exactly the same as that which would run on the actual robots. Such a simulation infrastructure is crucial to ?quickly? execute experiments with different parameters such as the number of robots or their initial positions.},

However, multirobot SLAM faces many challenging problems, including unknown robot poses, unshared map, and unstable communication. In this paper, a map merging algorithm based on virtual robot motion is proposed for multi-robot SLAM. The thinning algorithm is used to construct the skeleton of the grid map's empty area, and a mobile robot is simulated in one map. The simulated data is used as information sources in the other map to do partial map Monte Carlo localization; if localization succeeds, the relative pose hypotheses between the two maps can be computed easily. We verify these hypotheses using the rendezvous technique and use them as initial values to optimize the estimation by a heuristic random search algorithm.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.Urban search and rescue robots explore the area which they don't know. They must localize themselves, map the environment, and choose their targets. The usage of robot teams can be very effective for large areas instead of a single robot. Robot teams can be managed with distributed or centric methodologies. In a distributed architecture, each robot should be self-sufficient by means of all search tasks. This also means that each robot needs a rich computational power. Moreover, an optimal exploration strategy requires communication between all the robots. A common way to get such an architecture is applying centric approaches. In centric approaches, each robot can be seen as a mobile sensor with little computational power. They send their measures to the center. The map is generated at the center. Navigation commands are generated at the center according to the exploration strategy. ROS is a very common platform for robotic researchers. It includes several single robot mapping algorithms. But, there is no common mapping algorithm for centric approaches. In this study, we developed a multi-robot version of Hector mapping which is widely used in most robotic researches. For the real-Time running ability, we parallelized its optimization procedure. The experimental results shows the effectiveness of our proposed architecture.},

However, online processing for global loop closure detection approaches is generally influenced by the size of the environment. The proposed graph-based SLAM system uses a memory management approach that only consider portions of the map to satisfy online processing requirements.

Objects are modelled with a set of rigidly attached sample points along their boundaries whose positions are initialised with and updated by raw laser measurements, thus allowing a nonparametric representation that is capable of representing objects independent of their classes and shapes. Detection and tracking of such object models are handled in a theoretically principled manner as a Bayes filter where the motion states and shape information of all objects are represented as a part of a joint state which includes in addition the pose of the sensor and geometry of the static part of the world. We derive the prediction and observation models for the evolution of the joint state, and describe how the knowledge of the static local background helps identifying dynamic objects from static ones in a principled and straightforward way. Dealing with raw laser points poses a significant challenge to data association. We propose a hierarchical approach, and present a new variant of the well-known Joint Compatibility Branch and Bound (JCBB) algorithm to respect and take advantage of the constraints of the problem introduced through correlations between observations. Finally, we calibrate the system systematically on real world data containing 7.5K labelled object examples and validate on 6K test cases. We demonstrate its performance over an existing industry standard targeted at the same problem domain as well as a classical approach to model-free object tracking.},

In the context of mobile robots this problem arises in localization and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with occupancy grid maps. The lack of a parameterized observation model for these maps forces a sample-based representation, commonly through Monte Carlo methods for sequential filtering, also called particle filters. Our work is grounded on the demonstrated existence of an optimal proposal distribution for particle filters. However, this optimal distribution is not directly applicable to systems with non-parametric models. By integrating ideas from previous works on adaptive sample size, auxiliary particle filters, and rejection sampling, we derive a new particle filter algorithm that enables the usage of the optimal proposal to estimate the true posterior density of a non-parametric dynamic system. This new filter is better suited, both theoretically and in practice, than previous approximate methods for indoor and outdoor localization and SLAM, as confirmed by experiments with real robots.},

However, few approaches to this problem scale up to handle the very large number of landmarks present in real environments. Kalman filter-based algorithms, for example, require time quadratic in the number of landmarks to incorporate each sensor observation. This paper presents FastSLAM, an algorithm that recursively estimates the full posterior distribution over robot pose and landmark locations, yet scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map. This algorithm is based on a factorization of the posterior into a product of conditional landmark distributions and a distribution over robot paths. The algorithm has been run successfully on as many as 50,000 landmarks, environments far beyond the reach of previous approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the FastSLAM algorithm on both simulated and real-world data.},

	abstract = {Multi robot systems are envisioned to play an important role in many robotic applications. A main prerequisite for a team deployed in a wide unknown area is the capability of autonomously navigate, exploiting the information acquired through the on-line estimation of both robot poses and surrounding environment model, according to Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) framework. As team coordination is improved, distributed techniques for filtering are required in order to enhance autonomous exploration and large scale SLAM increasing both efficiency and robustness of operation. Although Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters (RBPF) have been demonstrated to be an effective solution to the problem of single robot SLAM, few extensions to teams of robots exist, and these approaches are characterized by strict assumptions on both communication bandwidth and prior knowledge on relative poses of the teammates. In the present paper we address the problem of multi robot SLAM in the case of limited communication and unknown relative initial poses. Starting from the well established single robot RBPF-SLAM, we propose a simple technique which jointly estimates SLAM posterior of the robots by fusing the prioceptive and the eteroceptive information acquired by each teammate. The approach intrinsically reduces the amount of data to be exchanged among the robots, while taking into account the uncertainty in relative pose measurements. Moreover it can be naturally extended to different communication technologies (bluetooth, RFId, wifi, etc.) regardless their sensing range. The proposed approach is validated through experimental test.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an approach to solve the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem with a team of cooperative autonomous vehicles. We consider that each robot is equipped with a stereo camera and is able to observe visual landmarks in the environment. The SLAM approach presented here is feature-based, thus the map is represented by a set of 3D landmarks each one defined by a global position in space and a visual descriptor. The robots move independently along different trajectories and make relative measurements to landmarks in the environment in order to jointly build a common map using a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. We show results obtained in a simulated environment that validate the SLAM approach. The process of observing a visual landmark is simulated in the following way: first, the relative measurement obtained by the robot is corrupted with Gaussian noise, using a noise model for a standard stereo camera. Second, the visual description of the landmark is altered by noise, simulating the changes in the descriptor which may occur when the robot observes the same landmark under different scales and viewpoints. In addition, the noise in the odometry of the robots also takes values obtained from real robots. We propose an approach to manage data associations in the context of visual features. Different experiments have been performed, with variations in the path followed by the robots and the parameters in the particle filter. Finally, the results obtained in simulation demonstrate that the approach is suitable for small robot teams. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Relaxing some assumptions that characterize related work we propose an application of Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters (RBPF) for the purpose of cooperatively estimating SLAM posterior. We consider a realistic setup in which the robots start from unknown initial poses (relative locations are unknown too), and travel in the environment in order to build a shared representation of the latter. The robots are required to exchange a small amount of information only when a rendezvous event occurs and to measure relative poses during the meeting.

The algorithm addresses the problem in which a team of robots builds a map on-line while simultaneously accommodating errors in the robots' odometry. At the core of the algorithm is a technique that combines fast maximum likelihood map growing with a Monte Carlo localizer that uses particle representations. The combination of both yields an on-line algorithm that can cope with large odometric errors typically found when mapping environments with cycles. The algorithm can be implemented in a distributed manner on multiple robot platforms, enabling a team of robots to cooperatively generate a single map of their environment.

	abstract = {Having a team of robots to perform a task such as mapping is faster and more reliable than doing the same with a single robot, which can be crucial in scenarios such as search and rescue. We are developing a fully distributed framework for collaborative mapping with large robot swarms that is robust to abrupt departure of robots due to malfunctions or network problems. While several approaches to multi-robot mapping have been proposed, most of them either build a collection of local sub-maps, or rely on a central authority to merge maps built by individual robots. Our framework is unique in that it requires no central authority, yet allows robots to simultaneously contribute to a single global map, which is stored in a decentralized fashion. This greatly improves the scalability of our system with respect to number of robots. However, our approach requires systematic coordination among robots in order to make modifications to the map. Unannounced departure of the robots makes coordination challenging, and can potentially make the map inconsistent or result in loss of data. We borrow ideas from the domain of distributed computing to address those challenges. Further, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed system by subjecting it to various conditions in which participating robots fail.},

In particular it examines ways in which vehicles, considered as independent agents, can share, update and leverage each others' visual experiences in a mutually beneficial way. We draw on our previous work in Experience-based Navigation (EBN) [1], in which a visual map supporting multiple representations of the same place is built, yielding real-time localisation capability for a solitary vehicle. We now consider how any number of such agents might operate in concert via data sharing policies that are germane to the shared task of lifelong localisation. We rapidly construct considerable maps by the conjoining of work distributed to asynchronous processes, and share expertise amongst the team by the selective dispensing of mission-specific map contents. We demonstrate and evaluate our system against 100km of data collected in North Oxford over a period of a month featuring diverse deviation in appearance due to atmospheric, lighting, and structural dynamics. We show that our framework is capable of creating maps in a fraction of the time required by single-agent EBN, with no significant loss in localisation robustness, and is able to furnish robots on real-world forays with maps which require much less storage.},

Tracked vehicles are capable of manoeuvring in highly variable and uneven terrain, but difficulties in their control have traditionally limited their use as autonomous platforms. Attempts to compensate for slip in environments typically require that both the forward and rotational velocities of a platform be determined, but this can be challenging. This paper shows that it is possible to estimate vehicle traction using only a rate gyroscope, by providing a suitable adaptive least squares estimator to do so. An approach to generating slip compensating controls when platform velocity constraints are applied is also presented. The approach is controller independent, but we make use of a model predictive controller, vulnerable to the effects of model-plant mismatch, to highlight the efficacy of the proposed estimation and compensation. Path following results using a mixture model to generate feasible slip values are presented, and show a significant increase in controller performance.},

This approach uses a particle filter in which each particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to reduce the number of particles. In this paper, we present adaptive techniques for reducing this number in a RBPF for learning grid maps. We propose an approach to compute an accurate proposal distribution, taking into account not only the movement of the robot, but also the most recent observation. This drastically decreases the uncertainty about the robot's pose in the prediction step of the filter. Furthermore, we present an approach to selectively carry out resampling operations, which seriously reduces the problem of particle depletion. Experimental results carried out with real mobile robots in large-scale indoor, as well as outdoor, environments illustrate the advantages of our methods over previous approaches},

But the core question of multirobot mapping is how to integrate the data of the different robots into a single global map. A significant amount of research exists in the area of multirobot mapping that deals with techniques to estimate the relative robots poses at the start or during the mapping process. With map merging, the robots in contrast individually build local maps without any knowledge about their relative positions. The goal is then to identify regions of overlap at which the local maps can be joined together. A concrete approach to this idea is presented in form of a special similarity metric and a stochastic search algorithm. Given two maps m and m', the search algorithm transforms m' by rotations and translations to find a maximum overlap between m and m'. In doing so, the heuristic similarity metric guides the search algorithm toward optimal solutions.

	abstract = {We illustrate our experience in developing and implementing algorithms for map merging, i.e., the problem of fusing two or more partial maps without common reference frames into one large global map. The partial maps may for example be acquired by multiple robots, or during several runs of a single robot from varying starting positions. Our work deals with low quality maps based on probabilistic grids, motivated by the goal to develop multiple mobile platforms to be used in rescue environments. Several contributions to map merging are presented. First of all, we address map merging using a motion planning algorithm. The merging process can be done by rotating and translating the partial maps until similar regions overlap. Second, a motion planning algorithm is presented which is particular suited for this task. Third, a special metric is presented which guides the motion planning algorithm towards the goal of optimally overlapping partial maps. Results with our approach are presented based on data gathered from real robots developed for the RoboCupRescue real robot league. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of FastSLAM - a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter formulation of simultaneous localisation and mapping. It shows that the algorithm degenerates with time, regardless of the number of particles used or the density of landmarks within the environment, and would always produce optimistic estimates of uncertainty in the long-term. In essence, FastSLAM behaves like a non-optimal local search algorithm; in the short-term it may produce consistent uncertainty estimates but, in the long-term, it is unable to adequately explore the state-space to be a reasonable Bayesian estimator. However, the number of particles and landmarks does affect the accuracy of the estimated mean and, given sufficient particles, FastSLAM can produce good non-stochastic estimates in practice. FastSLAM also has several practical advantages, particularly with regard to data association, and would probably work well in combination with other versions of stochastic SLAM, such as EKF-based SLAM},

	abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots need a map of the environment for navigation. Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) is essential for autonomous navigation, path planning and obstacle avoidance. SLAM describes a process of building a map of an unknown envi- ronment and computing at the same time the current robot position. Both steps depend on each other. A good map is necessary to compute the robot position and on the other hand just an accurate position estimate yields to a correct map. Several popular SLAM packages, like DP-SLAM, GMapping or GridSLAM are available for research purposes and allow a not yet available and meaningful comparison between sensors and algorithms. The aim of this work is to find a robust method to generate 2D or 3D maps with recent sensor technologies. We compare a grid based method with two implementations of geo- metric feature based SLAM algorithms. All methods rely on a probabilistic estimate of the robot state realised with a Particle Filter. Recent sensor technologies: Laser range finders, sonar sensors and time of flight cameras are evaluated with respect to accuracy and robustness. Laser beam based sensors yield to the most exact results and are com- monly used. Because of the low price of sonar sensors, ambitious efforts are being made to build cheap household robots. The last sensor technology, listed, is the newest and allows 3D scans of the environment. The experiments take place in indoor environments and a quantitative evaluation of the results is performed with the recently published RawSeeds datasets.},

These can make the filter inconsistent. Another challenge is to reduce the number of particles while maintaining the estimation accuracy. This paper provides a robust new algorithm based on the scaled unscented transformation called unscented FastSLAM (UFastSLAM). It overcomes the important drawbacks of the previous frameworks by directly using nonlinear relations. This approach improves the filter consistency and state estimation accuracy, and requires smaller number of particles than the FastSLAM approach. Simulation results in large-scale environments and experimental results with a benchmark dataset are presented, demonstrating the superiority of the UFastSLAM algorithm.},

The starting point is the single-robot Rao?Blackwellized particle filter described by H{\"{a}}hnel et al., and three key generalizations are made.First, the particle filter is extended to handle multi-robot SLAM problems in which the ini- tial pose of the robots is known (such as occurs when all robots start from the same location). Second, an approximation is introduced to solve the more general problem in which the initial pose of robots is not known a priori (such as occurs when the robots start from widely separated locations). In this latter case, it is assumed that pairs of robots will eventually encounter one another, thereby determining their relative pose. This relative attitude is used to initialize the filter, and subsequent observations from both robots are combined into a common map. Third and finally, a method is introduced to integrate observations collected prior to the first robot encounter, using the notion of a virtual robot travelling backwards in time. This novel ap- proach allows one to integrate all data from all robots into a single common map.},

	abstract = {Robot ic mapping has been an active research area in robotics for last two decades. An accurat map is a mandatory requirement for a robot to work autonomously. In addition the robot requires to know its position with respect to a given map and this is solved through robot localization. The problem of olving both map building and robot localization i addressed by simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). A large volume of literature is available to solve the SLAM problem using a ingle robot. A robot will take a series of sensor readings about an unexplor d area and then continues to build the map while knowing its po ition reference to partially built map. However, when an area becomes larger multi-robot SLAM is more efficient and al o has the advantage of sharing the computational burden among several robots. Solving SLAM problem using multiple robot is important when there i large terrain to map and perhaps it will beyond the capability of single robot. Even if it is within the capability of single robot such a deployment will not be cost and time effective. Therefore this research focuses on developing a multi-robot SLAM filter based on Fa tSLAM algorithm. Single Pioneer 3AT robot was deployed to collect odometry and sensor readings. Grid based fa tSLAM algorithm is implemented on MATLAB program code for off- line processing and successfully generated the map of the environment. The data t obtained from ingle robot was divided into two data sets and they w r treat d as if th y w re obtained from two different robots. Single robot grid based fastSLAM algorithm was applied to both of the data sets and obtained two maps. Two map wer merged using Hough transform based map merging technique. Maps obtained from ingle robot SLAM and multi-robot SLAM is compared and multi-robot SLAM algorithm provides maps as same accuracy as single robot SLAM.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is an essential capability for mobile robots exploring unknown environments. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has served as the de-facto approach to SLAM for the last fifteen years. However, EKF-based SLAM algorithms suffer from two well-known shortcomings that complicate their application to large, real-world environments: quadratic complexity and sensitivity to failures in data association. I will present an alternative approach to SLAM that specifically addresses these two areas. This approach, called FastSLAM, factors the full SLAM posterior exactly into a product of a robot path posterior, and N landmark posteriors conditioned on the robot path estimate. This factored posterior can be approximated efficiently using a particle filter. The time required to incorporate an observation into FastSLAM scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map. In addition to sampling over robot paths, FastSLAM can sample over potential data associations. Sampling over data associations enables FastSLAM to be used in environments with highly ambiguous landmark identities. This dissertation will describe the FastSLAM algorithm given both known and unknown data association. The performance of FastSLAM will be compared against the EKF on simulated and real-world data sets. Results will show that FastSLAM can produce accurate maps in extremely large environments, and in environments with substantial data association ambiguity. Finally, a convergence proof for FastSLAM in the linear-Gaussian case and an extension of FastSLAM to dynamic worlds will be presented.},

	abstract = {A new solution to the Simultaneous Localization and Modelling problem is presented in this paper. The algorithm is based on the stochastic search for solutions in the state space to the global localization problem by means of a differential evolution algorithm. This non linear evolutive filter, called Evolutive Localization Filter (ELF), searches stochastically along the state space for the best robot pose estimate. The set of pose solutions (the population) focuses on the most likely areas according to the perception and up to date motion information. The population evolves using the log-likelihood of each candidate pose according to the observation and the motion errors derived from the comparison between observed and predicted data obtained from the probabilistic perception and motion model. The proposed SLAM algorithm operates in two steps: in the first step the ELF filter is used at local level to re-localize the robot based on the robot odometry, the laser scan at a given position and a local map where only a low number of the last scans have been integrated. In the second step, the aligned laser measures and the corrected robot poses are used to detect whether the robot is revisiting a previously crossed area (i.e.,�a cycle in the robot trajectory exists). Once a cycle is detected, the Evolutive Localization Filter is used again to estimate the accumulated residual drift in the detected loop and then to re-estimate the robot poses in order to integrate the sensor measures in the global map of the environment. The algorithm has been tested in different environments to demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach.},

However, the above techniques have two important potential limitations, which are the derivation of the Jacobian matrices and the linear approximations to the nonlinear functions. Also, one of the major challenges of both Rao-Blackwellized particle filter and FastSLAM is to reduce the number of particles while maintaining the estimation accuracy. This paper proposes a new algorithm based on unscented transformation called Unscented FastSLAM (UFastSLAM) that overcomes important drawbacks of the Rao-Blackwellized particle filter frameworks by directly using nonlinear relations. Experimental results in large scale environments are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of the UFastSLAM algorithm over the previous approaches.},

	abstract = {The ability to simultaneously localize a robot and accurately map its surroundings is considered by many to be a key prerequisite of truly autonomous robots. However, few approaches to this problem scale up to handle the very large number of landmarks present in real environments. Kalman filter-based algorithms, for example, require time quadratic in the number of landmarks to incorporate each sensor observation. This paper presents FastSLAM, an algorithm that recursively estimates the full posterior distribution over robot pose and landmark locations, yet scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map. This algorithm is based on a factorization of the posterior into a product of conditional landmark distributions and a distribution over robot paths. The algorithm has been run successfully on as many as 50,000 landmarks, environments far beyond the reach of previous approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the FastSLAM algorithm on both simulated and real-world data.},

An algorithm for, model-based localization that relies on the concept of a geometric beacon, a naturally occurring environment feature that can be reliably observed in successive sensor measurements and can be accurately described in terms of a concise geometric parameterization, is developed. The algorithm is based on an extended Kalman filter that utilizes matches between observed geometric beacons and an a priori map of beacon locations. Two implementations of this navigation algorithm, both of which use sonar, are described. The first implementation uses a simple vehicle with point kinematics equipped with a single rotating sonar. The second implementation uses a `Robuter' mobile robot and six static sonar transducers to provide localization information while the vehicle moves at typical speeds of 30 cm/s},

This paper also describes a substantial implementation of the SLAM algorithm on a vehicle operating in an out- door environment using millimeter-wave (MMW) radar to provide relative map observations.This implementation is used to demonstrate how some key issues such as map man- agement and data association can be handled in a practical environment.The results obtained are cross-compared with absolute locations of the map landmarks obtained by sur- veying.In conclusion, this paper discusses a number of key issues raised by the solution to the SLAM problem including sub-optimal map-building algorithms and map management},

This estimation method can be used to answer such questions as whether a camera attached to a robot is likely to have a particular reference object in its field of view. The calculated estimates agree well with those from an independent Monte Carlo simulation. The method makes it possible to decide in advance whether an uncertain relationship is known accu rately enough for some task and, if not, how much of an improvement in locational knowledge a proposed sensor will provide. The method presented can be generalized to six degrees offreedom and provides a practical means of esti mating the relationships ( position and orientation) among objects, as well as estimating the uncertainty associated with the relationships.},

abstract="We present a lazy data association algorithm for the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. Our approach uses a tree-structured Bayesian representation of map posteriors that makes it possible to revise data association decisions arbitrarily far into the past. We describe a criterion for detecting and repairing poor data association decisions. This technique makes it possible to acquire maps of large-scale environments with many loops, with a minimum of computational overhead for the management of multiple data association hypotheses. A empirical comparison with the popular FastSLAM algorithm shows the advantage of lazy over proactive data association.",

	abstract = {This book delivers concise coverage of classical methods and new developments related to indoor location-based services. It collects results from isolated domains including geometry, artificial intelligence, statistics, cooperative algorithms, and distributed systems and thus provides an accessible overview of fundamental methods and technologies. This makes it an ideal starting point for researchers, students, and professionals in pervasive computing. Location-based services are services using the location of a mobile computing device as their primary input. While such services are fairly easy to implement outside buildings thanks to accessible global positioning systems and high-quality environmental information, the situation inside buildings is fundamentally different. In general, there is no simple way of determining the position of a moving target inside a building without an additional dedicated infrastructure. The book's structure is learning oriented, starting with a short introduction to wireless communication systems and basic positioning techniques and ending with advanced features like event detection, simultaneous localization and mapping, and privacy aspects. Readers who are not familiar with the individual topics will be able to work through the book from start to finish. At the same time all chapters are self-contained to support readers who are already familiar with some of the content and only want to pick selected topics that are of particular interest. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

	abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

	abstract = {We present a novel, laser range finder based algorithm for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for mobile robots. SLAM addresses the problem of con- structing an accurate map in real time despite imperfect information about the robot's trajectory through the en- vironment. Unlike other approaches that assume prede- termined landmarks (and must deal with a resulting data- association problem) our algorithm is purely laser based. Our algorithm uses a particle filter to represent both robot poses and possible map configurations. By using a new map representation, which we call distributed particle (DP) mapping, we are able to maintain and update hun- dreds of candidate maps and robot poses efficiently. The worst-case complexity of our algorithm per laser sweep is log-quadratic in the number of particles we maintain and linear in the area swept out by the laser. However, in practice our run time is usually much less than that. Our technique contains essentially no assumptions about the environment yet it is accurate enough to close loops of 60m in length with crisp, perpendicular edges on corri- dors and minimal or no misalignment errors.},

	abstract = {This thesis focuses on the problem of SLAM, in particular feature-based SLAM, where a mobile autonomous vehicle explores an unknown environ- ment, navigating by observing landmarks. As the environment is previously unexplored, SLAM algorithms must estimate the location of the landmarks in addition to the location of the vehicle. The majority of research in feature- based SLAM builds on the legacy of foundational work using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), a single-object estimation technique. Because feature- based SLAM is an inherently multi-object problem, this has led to a number of suboptimalities in popular solutions. We hypothesize that a feature based SLAM algorithm derived frommulti-object estimation techniques can achieve superior estimation performance compared to conventional algorithms, es- pecially in conditions which highlight the weaknesses of the single-object approach. In this work, we develop such an algorithm, using the SC-PHD filter, a multi-object estimator modeled on cluster processes. This algorithm hosts capabilities not typically seen with feature-base SLAM solutions such as principled handling of false alarm measurements and missed detections, and navigation with a mixture of stationary and moving landmarks. We present experiments with the SC-PHD SLAM algorithm on both synthetic and real datasets using an autonomous underwater vehicle. We also compare our method to the RB-PHD SLAM, showing that it requires fewer approxi- mations in its derivation and thus achieves superior performance.

A roadmap of the explored area, with the associate safe region, is built in the form of a sensor-based random graph (SRG). This is expanded by the robots by using a randomized local planner that automatically realizes a tradeoff between information gain and navigation cost. The nodes of the SRG represent view configurations that have been visited by at least one robot, and are connected by arcs that represent safe paths. These paths have been actually traveled by the robots or added to the SRG to improve its connectivity. Decentralized cooperation and coordination mechanisms are used so as to guarantee exploration efficiency and avoid conflicts. Simulations and experiments are presented to show the performance of the proposed technique.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a closed form solution to the multiple platform simultaneous localisation and map building (SLAM) problem. Closed form solutions are presented in both state space and information based forms. A key conclusion of this paper is that the information-state based form offers many advantages over the state space formulation in allowing the SLAM algorithm to be decentralised across multiple platforms. The benefits of operating SLAM in an information form are numerous. The additive properties of the information update make it especially attractive, as does the ability to predict estimates through any direction in time. However, of paramount importance is the well-known ability to decentralise the information filter. A general form of the continuous time inverse covariance matrix for the SLAM problem is presented to determine such properties as the initial and steady state conditions. These properties are investigated to determine their dependence and relationship to both the observation and process noise. Examination of the structure of the general form of the inverse covariance matrix also gives an insight into what information should be communicated between platforms in the decentralised architecture and how it can be managed.},

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles require the ability to build maps of an unknown environment while concurrently using these maps for navigation. Current algorithms for this concurrent mapping and localization (CML) problem have been implemented for single vehicles, but do not account for extra positional information available when multiple vehicles operate simultaneously. Multiple vehicles have the potential to map an environment more quickly and robustly than a single vehicle. This paper presents a cooperative CML algorithm that merges sensor and navigation information from multiple autonomous vehicles. The algorithm presented is based on stochastic estimation and uses a feature-based approach to extract landmarks from the environment. The theoretical framework for the collaborative CML algorithm is presented, and a convergence theorem central to the cooperative CML problem. is proved for the first time. This theorem quantifies the performance gains of collaboration, allowing for determination of the number of cooperating vehicles required to accomplish a task. A simulated implementation of the collaborative CML algorithm demonstrates substantial performance improvement over non-cooperative CML.},

Furthermore, by exploiting the ability of the robots to see each other, we can detect opaque obstacles in the environment independently of their surface reflectance properties.

abstract = "This paper addresses the cooperative localization and visual mapping problem with multiple heterogeneous robots. The approach is designed to deal with the challenging large semi-structured outdoors environments in which aerial/ground ensembles are to evolve. We propose the use of heterogeneous visual landmarks, points and line segments, to achieve effective cooperation in such environments. A large-scale SLAM algorithm is generalized to handle multiple robots, in which a global graph maintains the relative relationships between a series of local sub-maps built by the different robots. The key issue when dealing with multiple robots is to find the link between them, and to integrate these relations to maintain the overall geometric consistency; the events that introduce these links on the global graph are described in detail. Monocular cameras are considered as the primary extereoceptive sensor. In order to achieve the undelayed initialization required by the bearing-only observations, the well-known inverse-depth parametrization is adopted to estimate 3D points. Similarly, to estimate 3D line segments, we present a novel parametrization based on anchored Plücker coordinates, to which extensible endpoints are added. Extensive simulations show the proposed developments, and the overall approach is illustrated using real-data taken with a helicopter and a ground rover."

For ease of use the original ROS ‘bag’ log files are provided and also a derivative version combining human readable data and imagery in standard formats. Of particular importance, this dataset also includes ground-truth position estimates of the robot at every instance (to typical accuracy of 2 cm) using as-built floor-plans—which were carefully extracted using our software tools.

The dataset is composed of 27 sessions spaced approximately biweekly over the course of 15 months. The sessions repeatedly explore the campus, both indoors and outdoors, on varying trajectories, and at different times of the day across all four seasons. This allows the dataset to capture many challenging elements including: moving obstacles (e.g. pedestrians, bicyclists and cars), changing lighting, varying viewpoint, seasonal and weather changes (e.g. falling leaves and snow), and long-term structural changes caused by construction projects. To further facilitate research, we also provide ground-truth pose for all sessions in a single frame of reference. }

abstract="This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.",

abstract = "This article presents a novel scale- and rotation-invariant detector and descriptor, coined SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features). SURF approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster. This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (specifically, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper encompasses a detailed description of the detector and descriptor and then explores the effects of the most important parameters. We conclude the article with SURF’s application to two challenging, yet converse goals: camera calibration as a special case of image registration, and object recognition. Our experiments underline SURF’s usefulness in a broad range of topics in computer vision."

ABSTRACT = {This paper addresses a new hybrid feature extractor algorithm, which in essence integrates a Fast-Hessian detector into the SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm. Feature extractors mainly consist of two essential parts: feature detector and descriptor extractor. This study proposes to integrate (Speeded-Up Robust Features) SURF’s hessian detector into the SIFT algorithm so as to boost the total number of true matched pairs. This is a critical requirement in image processing and widely used in various corresponding fields from image stitching to object recognition. The proposed hybrid algorithm has been tested under different experimental conditions and results are quite encouraging in terms of obtaining higher matched pairs and precision score.},

    abstract = { In this paper we describe Atlas, a hybrid metrical/topological approach to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) that achieves efficient mapping of large-scale environments. The representation is a graph of coordinate frames, with each vertex in the graph representing a local frame and each edge representing the transformation between adjacent frames. In each frame, we build a map that captures the local environment and the current robot pose along with the uncertainties of each. Each map’s uncertainties are modeled with respect to its own frame. Probabilities of entities with respect to arbitrary frames are generated by following a path formed by the edges between adjacent frames, computed using either the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm or breath-first search. Loop closing is achieved via an efficient map-matching algorithm coupled with a cycle verification step. We demonstrate the performance of the technique for post-processing large data sets, including an indoor structured environment (2.2 km path length) with multiple nested loops using laser or ultrasonic ranging sensors. }

@article{Newman1999,
abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the simultaneous localisation and map building (SLAM) problem. The SLAM problem asks if it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown environment and then to incrementally build a map of this environment while simultaneously using this map to compute absolute vehicle location. The map and robot location estimates obtained from a successful SLAMsystem provide essential information upon which high level tasks such as path planning are predicated. A practicable solution to the SLAMproblem is of inestimable value in the quest to create a truly autonomous mobile robot. The thesis has three principal theoretical contributions. The first is the elucidation of the structure of the SLAM problem. This is achieved by the analysis of a conventional and well known SLAMalgorithm using global coordinates called, in this thesis, the Absolute Map Filter or AMF. Using this algorithm, three convergence theorems central to the SLAM problem are proved for the first time. They prove that the uncertainty in the estimated map decreases monotonically and achieves a defined lower bound. Futhermore, in the limit as the number of landmark observations increases, the relationship between landmarks becomes perfectly known. These proofs constitute the second theoretical contribution of the thesis. The third principal theoretical contribution of this thesis is the development of a novel SLAM solution capable of solving the SLAM problem in real time. This algorithm is called the Geometric Projection Filter or GPF. Rather than estimate the location of landmarks in global coordinates it estimates the relationships between individual landmarks. The convergence properties of this algorithm are derived and compared with those of the conventional AMF algorithm. An implementation of the GPF and the AMF is provided on a custom built subsea vehicle. The performance of the two filters are compared and shown to have the properties predicted by the preceding theoretical analysis. This implementation constitutes the fourth principal contribution of the thesis. It shows that the GPF can be used as the basis of a substantive real time deployment of a mobile robot in an initially unknown environment.},

    abstract = { In this paper we describe a scalable algorithm for the simultaneous mapping and localization (SLAM) problem. SLAM is the problem of acquiring a map of a static environment with a mobile robot. The vast majority of SLAM algorithms are based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF). In this paper we advocate an algorithm that relies on the dual of the EKF, the extended information filter (EIF). We show that when represented in the information form, map posteriors are dominated by a small number of links that tie together nearby features in the map. This insight is developed into a sparse variant of the EIF, called the sparse extended information filter (SEIF). SEIFs represent maps by graphical networks of features that are locally interconnected, where links represent relative information between pairs of nearby features, as well as information about the robot’s pose relative to the map. We show that all essential update equations in SEIFs can be executed in constant time, irrespective of the size of the map. We also provide empirical results obtained for a benchmark data set collected in an outdoor environment, and using a multi-robot mapping simulation. }

This method enables a team of robots to build joint maps with or without initial knowledge of their relative poses. To accomplish the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping this method uses Square Root Information Smoothing (SRIS). In contrast to traditional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) methods the smoothing does not exclude any information and is therefore also better equipped to deal with non-linear process and measurement models. The method proposed does not require the collaborative robots to have initial correspondence. The key contribution of this work is an optimal smoothing algorithm for merging maps that are created by different robots independently or in groups. The method not only joins maps from different robots, it also recovers the complete robot trajectory for each robot involved in the map joining. It is also shown how data association between duplicate features is done and how this reduces uncertainty in the complete map. Two simulated scenarios are presented where the C-SAM algorithm is applied on two individually created maps. One basically joins two maps resulting in a large map while the other shows a scenario where sensor extension is carried out. {\textcopyright}2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the cooperative localization and visual mapping problem with multiple heterogeneous robots. The approach is designed to deal with the challenging large semi-structured outdoors environments in which aerial/ground ensembles are to evolve. We propose the use of heterogeneous visual landmarks, points and line segments, to achieve effective cooperation in such environments. A large-scale SLAM algorithm is generalized to handle multiple robots, in which a global graph maintains the relative relationships between a series of local sub-maps built by the different robots. The key issue when dealing with multiple robots is to find the link between them, and to integrate these relations to maintain the overall geometric consistency; the events that introduce these links on the global graph are described in detail. Monocular cameras are considered as the primary extereoceptive sensor. In order to achieve the undelayed initialization required by the bearing-only observations, the well-known inverse-depth parametrization is adopted to estimate 3D points. Similarly, to estimate 3D line segments, we present a novel parametrization based on anchored Plcker coordinates, to which extensible endpoints are added. Extensive simulations show the proposed developments, and the overall approach is illustrated using real-data taken with a helicopter and a ground rover. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, few approaches to this problem scale up to handle the very large number of landmarks present in real environments. Kalman filter-based algorithms, for example, require time quadratic in the number of landmarks to incorporate each sensor observation. This paper presents FastSLAM, an algorithm that recursively estimates the full posterior distribution over robot pose and landmark locations, yet scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map. This algorithm is based on a factorization of the posterior into a product of conditional landmark distributions and a distribution over robot paths. The algorithm has been run successfully on as many as 50,000 landmarks, environments far beyond the reach of previous approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the FastSLAM algorithm on both simulated and real-world data.},

abstract = {Random sample consensus (RANSAC) has become one of the most successful techniques for robust estimation from a data set that may contain outliers. It works by constructing model hypotheses from random minimal data subsets and evaluating their validity from the support of the whole data. In this paper we present a novel combination of RANSAC plus extended Kalman filter (EKF) that uses the available prior probabilistic information from the EKF in the RANSAC model hypothesize stage. This allows the minimal sample size to be reduced to one, resulting in large computational savings without the loss of discriminative power. 1-Point RANSAC is shown to outperform both in accuracy and computational cost the joint compatibility branch and bound (JCBB) algorithm, a gold-standard technique for spurious rejection within the EKF framework. Two visual estimation scenarios are used in the experiments: first, six-degree-of-freedom (DOF) motion estimation from a monocular sequence (structure from motion). Here, a newmethod for benchmarking six-DOF visual estimation algorithms based on the use of high-resolution images is presented, validated, and used to show the superiority of 1-point RANSAC. Second, we demonstrate long-term robot trajectory estimation combining monocular vision and wheel odometry (visual odometry). Here, a comparison against global positioning system shows an accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art visual odometry methods. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract="Decoupled stochastic mapping (DSM) is a computationally efficient approach to large-scale concurrent mapping and localization. DSM reduces the computational burden of conventional stochastic mapping by dividing the environment into multiple overlapping submap regions, each with its own stochastic map. Two new approximation techniques are utilized for transferring vehicle state information from one submap to another, yielding a constant-time algorithm whose memory requirements scale linearly with the size of the operating area. The performance of two different variations of the algorithm is demonstrated through simulations of environments with 110 and 1200 features. Experimental results are presented for an environment with 93 features using sonar data obtained in a 3 by 9 by 1 meter testing tank.",

abstract = "Terminal constraints of robot end effectors from kinematic chains and the free motions under these constraints are discussed. The analytical theory of constraint space of the end effector of parallel robotic mechanism is studied according to the terminal constraint space of its kinematic chains. The degree of freedom of the end effector of a parallel robot should have the three attributes, namely, quantity, type, and direction. The degree of freedom of robot end effector is one of the core issues in the free motion analysis of mechanisms. Therefore, this chapter establishes analytical theory for the constrained space of the end effectors. On this basis, the equivalent description of the complex kinematic chain is discussed, which provides a theoretical support for the equivalent description of the complex kinematic chains to pure serial kinematic chains and lays a foundation for the study of actuation of the prescribed end effector."
